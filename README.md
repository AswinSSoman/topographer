topographer: single-cell analysis toolkit for expression with MATLAB

This package implements a set of statistical methods for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data with MATLAB. Briefly, topographer enables the following:

(1) identifying the backbone of cell trajectories from single-cell data   
(2) constructing a developmental landscape based on the data   
(3) revealing stochastic dynamics of cell types in the data system  
(4) inferring dynamic connections of marker gene networks along identified cell trajectories   
(5) inferring dynamic changes of transcriptional bursting kinetics also along identified cell trajectories.
